Introduction
============

Here you should introduce what your library does.

`reStructuredText <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/basics.html>`_ is powerful and extensible markup.

.. important:: Make sure to use directives such as:

   - ``.. important::``
   - ``.. note::``

.. seealso:: You can reference external libraries through `intersphinx <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/ext/intersphinx.html>`_.
   For example, :py:meth:`requests.post` or :py:class:`~requests.Session`.

.. warning:: Some directives are available only on sphinx, such as `.. deprecated:: <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html#directive-deprecated>`_

.. deprecated:: 0.0.1
   This is useful to document breaking changes in the API.
